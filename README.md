# Covid-19 Model ðŸ¦ 
_Using Artificial Intelligence to model the Covid-19 pandemic_

### Introduction 
As part of the OsloMet Course: "ACIT4610: Evolutionary artificial intelligence and robotics", this project will try to create a realistic epidemic model based on complex system models.

### Project goal
The model will aim towards a most accurate representation of how the Covid-19 Virus behaves in regards of infection rate, recovery rate and spread. Furthermore, parameters will be added that optimizes the realism, e.g. if a person is wearing a surgical mask.
